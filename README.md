# Tooter [Fork]

## About
Tooter is Mastodon client for Sailfish OS. It is a free, open-source social network. A decentralized alternative to commercial platforms, it avoids the risks of a single company monopolizing your communication. 

This fork is being used to further develop and maintain the Tooter app by dysk0 (https://github.com/dysk0/harbour-tooter). The development branch 'upstream' is being used to create pull requests from this fork. Releases by dysk0 can be found on the Jolla store and on https://openrepos.net/content/dysko/tooter

Releases from this forked repository can be found here: https://openrepos.net/content/molan/tooter-fork.

## Build 
Clone / download this repository and import it in your SailfishOS IDE using the harbour-tooter.pro project file. No additional configuration needed. 

## Repository branches:
- master: default
- develop: commits WIP
- upstream: commits for Tooter release

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are very welcome, since I don't have the resources and time to implement and fix everything Tooter still misses or lacks. Thank you!
